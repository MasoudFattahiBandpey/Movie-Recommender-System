# Movie Recommender System

Welcome to the **Movie Recommender System** project! This project utilizes machine learning techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations, enhancing user experience and boosting engagement for streaming platforms.

## Introduction

In today's world of entertainment, the vast array of movies across various platforms can be overwhelming. This project addresses the challenge by building a smart recommender system that suggests movies tailored to individual tastes.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Utilizes user profiles, viewing history, and movie metadata.
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Implements collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid models.
- **Robust Data Handling**: Employs the comprehensive MovieLens dataset.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates accuracy using RMSE.
- **Cold Start Solutions**: Provides top-rated and genre-specific recommendations for new users.

## Dataset

The project uses the Full MovieLens Dataset, which includes a rich repository of movie-related information such as cast, crew, user ratings, and more. The dataset can be obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

## Algorithms and Techniques

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Predicts user preferences based on similar users.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies with similar content.
- **Hybrid Models**: Combines collaborative and content-based approaches for enhanced recommendations.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Uses RMSE to gauge the accuracy and reliability of the recommendations.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains datasets used for the project.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with detailed code and explanations.
- `src/`: Source code for building and evaluating the recommender system.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.
